# 📊 Professional Report Generation Guide

## ✅ **Integration Complete!**

The new professional `ReportGenerator` class has been successfully integrated into your penetration testing tool. When you use the `--output` flag with an `.html` extension, it will now generate beautiful, professional reports instead of basic HTML.

## 🚀 **How to Generate Professional Reports**

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
# Generate professional HTML report
python run.py --url https://example.com --output report.html

# Advanced crawler with professional report
python run.py --url https://example.com --mode advanced --output security_assessment.html

# Autonomous mode with professional report
python run.py --url https://example.com --mode autonomous --output pentest_report.html
```

### **Report Formats Available**
- **`.html`** → Professional interactive HTML report (NEW!)
