# 🔧 GUI Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "Network error: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON"

This error occurs when the JavaScript frontend tries to load scan results but receives an HTML error page instead of JSON data.

### 🔍 Root Cause
The scan ID `scan_1753820397_0` doesn't exist in the Flask server's memory, likely because:
- The server was restarted and lost in-memory scan data
- The scan was created in a different session
- There's a mismatch between the scan ID in the URL and actual scan data

### ✅ Fixes Applied

1. **Better Error Handling**: Added proper HTTP status codes and JSON error responses
2. **Historical Data Loading**: Server now tries to load results from the `reports/` directory if not found in memory
3. **Improved JavaScript**: Better error detection and user-friendly error messages
4. **Debug Endpoint**: Added `/api/debug/<scan_id>` to help troubleshoot issues

### 🚀 How to Test the Fix

1. **Start the GUI server**:
   ```bash
   python start_gui.py
   ```

2. **Test the debug endpoint** (replace `scan_1753820397_0` with your scan ID):
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/debug/scan_1753820397_0
   ```

3. **Try loading results directly**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/scan_results/scan_1753820397_0
   ```

4. **Test historical data loading**: The server will now attempt to load any results from the `reports/` directory

### 🎯 Expected Results

- ✅ **JSON Response**: All API endpoints should return proper JSON
- ✅ **Historical Data**: Old scan results should load from saved reports
- ✅ **Better Errors**: Clear error messages instead of HTML parsing errors
- ✅ **Export Working**: Both JSON and HTML export should work

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Run a new scan** to generate fresh data
2. **Check the reports directory** for any existing scan data
3. **Use the debug endpoint** to verify scan data availability

### 🔧 Manual Verification

You can manually check what data is available:

```bash
# Check what reports exist
ls reports/

# Check what the API returns
curl http://localhost:5000/api/debug/scan_1753820397_0
```

The GUI should now properly handle missing scan data and provide clear error messages instead of JSON parsing errors.
